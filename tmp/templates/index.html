    <p>Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something.
      </br>What you know you can’t explain. But you feel it.
      </br>You’ve felt it your entire life. There's something wrong with the world.
      </br>You don't know what it is, but it's there. Like a splinter in your mind.
      </br>Driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me.
    </br>The [Censored] is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room.</p>
